**GPT-Based Smart Assistant**

#### **Description**  
This project is a voice-activated smart assistant powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model. It enables users to interact with a conversational AI through voice commands, receive text and spoken responses, and perform specific tasks like opening websites. The assistant leverages speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and GPT-based natural language understanding for an intuitive user experience.

---

#### **Features**  
1. **Voice Recognition**: Converts user voice commands into text using the SpeechRecognition library.
2. **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate intelligent and context-aware replies.
3. **Text-to-Speech Output**: Outputs responses in a natural-sounding voice using pyttsx3.
4. **Browser Integration**: Supports specific commands to open websites like YouTube and Google.
5. **Continuous Interaction**: Listens for commands in a loop until the user exits with a "bye" command.

#### **Setup Instructions**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd GPT-Based-Smart-Assistant
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Use `pip` to install the required Python packages:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Your API Key**:  
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `apikey.py` file as `api_data`.

4. **Run the Application**:  
   Execute the main script:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

---

#### **Usage**  
1. Start the assistant and speak your command when prompted.
2. Commands include:  
   - General queries or conversations (e.g., "What's the weather like today?").
   - Task-based commands (e.g., "Open YouTube" or "Open Google").
   - End interaction with "bye".

---

#### **Requirements**  
- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Required Python libraries:
  - `openai`
  - `speechrecognition`
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `webbrowser` (built-in module)

---

#### **Known Issues and Limitations**  
- The assistant may not recognize some accents or speech patterns accurately.
- Limited command set for browser interactions.
- Requires a stable internet connection for API calls to OpenAI.

---

#### **Future Improvements**  
- Add more website commands and functionalities.
- Enhance error handling for unrecognized speech or failed API calls.
- Improve naturalness of the text-to-speech output.
- Support for multiple languages and regional accents.
